    <p>
    
        1. Preparing the rice:

Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes.
In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the bay leaf, green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt.
Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Cook the rice until it is 70-80% cooked (it should still have a bite to it). Drain the rice and set aside.
<br>
2. Marinating the chicken:


In a bowl, mix the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt.
Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and mix well. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer for better flavor.
<br>
3. Cooking the chicken:

In a large pan or pot, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat.
Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown.
Add the chopped tomatoes, green chilies, and ginger-garlic paste. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil starts to separate.
Add the marinated chicken along with the marinade. Cook for 10-15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the oil starts to separate.
Add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for another 5 minutes.

Stir in the chopped cilantro and mint leaves.
<br>
4. Assembling the biryani:

In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, layer half of the cooked rice at the bottom.
Add the cooked chicken mixture over the rice.
Top with the remaining rice.
If using, drizzle the saffron milk over the rice and sprinkle the fried onions on top.
Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal with aluminum foil. Cook on low heat (dum) for 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
<br>
5. Serving:

Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork.
Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) and salad.
Enjoy your delicious chicken biryani!
